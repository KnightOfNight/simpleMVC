/**
*
* TODO List
*
*
* Verify ability to save "NULL" into a column.
*
*
* Model class should have a method for each CRUD function.
*
*
* Create new class called "Search".  It will have methods to build a search
* query.  It store the query information and pass it to the database.
*
* Ideas for storage of the criteria...
* class - use current class Criteria (clean it up)
* hash
* JSON
*
* The Search class should know *some things* about paging.
*
* Search class should be able to return number of results in the entire search.
* This method will be used by the pager to determine things like whether or not
* there are previous or following pages.
*
*
*
* Standardize fully qualified column names.  Don't change the period to an
* underscore in results.
*
*
*
* Make configuration handler return NULL if the item is not set.  It should log
* a warning if it has to return NULL.
*
*
*
* Make controller class file names match the class name.  If it is upper-case
* in the application configuration, the file and class should be upper-case.
* If lower, the same.
*
*
*
* When logging out, don't clear session.  Just unauthorize it.
*
*
*
* Check all classes for singletons, and make the appropriate changes.  See
* classes Dispatch and Session as examples.
*
*
*
* IP - Some more functions to handle paging easier.
