/**
*
* TODO List
*
* Move all framework-specific models, controllers, and views to their own
* directory structure similar to "app".  Call it "mvc".  Place it under "lib".
*
*
*
* Give table names a prefix.  Framework-specific tables should be named
* mvc_<table name>, application-specific tables should be named app_<table
* name>.
*
* The prefix should be automatically prepended to the base table name, which
* should be the lower-case pluralization of the model class name minus "Model".
*
*
*
* When logging out, don't clear session.  Just unauthorize it.
*
*
*
* Check all classes for singletons, and make the appropriate changes.  See
* classes Dispatch and Session as examples.
*
*
*
* IP - Some more functions to handle paging easier.
*
*
*
* IP - Urgent - need access to current route.
