/**
*
* TODO List
*
* Make configuration handler return NULL if the item is not set.  It should log a warning if
* it has to return NULL.
*
*
*
* Make controller class file names match the class name.  If it is upper-case in the application
* configuration, the file and class should be upper-case.  If lower, the same.
*
*
*
* When logging out, don't clear session.  Just unauthorize it.
*
*
*
* Check all classes for singletons, and make the appropriate changes.  See
* classes Dispatch and Session as examples.
*
*
*
* IP - Some more functions to handle paging easier.
*
*
*
* IP - Urgent - need access to current route.
