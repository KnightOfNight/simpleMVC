A route consists of 3 basic parts: a controller, an action, and a query string.

It is formatted as a string as follows...

/<controller>/<action>/<query>[/<query>]

The controller manages the entire request.  It executes the action, which
handles all interaction between the database model and the associated view, if
any.

The query string is optional can be one or more values separated by /'s.
